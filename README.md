This is a very simple command line script to convert images to HTML tables.

## Usage

    python img2html.py image.png

That's it!  The script reads from the specified image file and outputs to stdout.

## Disclaimers

This was a very quick proof of concept, there is no testing, no package setup, it could be cleaner, etc.
