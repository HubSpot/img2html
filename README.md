This is a very simple command line script to convert images to HTML tables.

## Usage

    from litmus.analytics import LitmusAnalytics

    litmus = LitmusAnalytics(LITMUS_ID, LITMUS_USER, LITMUS_PASSWORD)
    tracking_code = litmus.get_tracking_code("Jonathan Manual Testing")

## Disclaimers

This was a very quick proof of concept, there is no testing, no package setup, it could be cleaner, etc.
